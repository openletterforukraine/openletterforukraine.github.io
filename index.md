# **Open Letter of European Academic Community Supporting an Embargo on Fossil Fuels from the Russian Federation**

We, European scientists, in the face of the brutal aggression of Vladimir Putin against an
independent country of Ukraine, appeal to the authorities of the European Union to immediately
impose an embargo on imports of coal, oil and natural gas from the Russian Federation.

Aware of economic and social consequences of imposing such an embargo on hydrocarbons, we
still think they do not constitute a sufficiently legitimate justification for the current passive
tolerance of the violence towards thousands of innocent victims and millions of refugees
displaced by this war. It is our moral duty to Ukraine, and to ourselves as Europeans who believe
in freedom and democracy, to sever all the economic ties with the aggressor until Ukrainians can
again live peacefully in their free country.

Maintaining and paying authoritarian Russia for deliveries of coal, oil and gas is a political
mistake. It gives to Putin the money he needs to prolong his war, which is unprecedented in
Europe since World War II and poses a threat to the European Union and to global security.
Therefore, we appeal for an immediate embargo on Russian fossil fuels.

As scientists, we declare a commitment to focused and intense scientific activities in our fields in
order to alleviate the adverse economic effects of a sharp reduction in imports of hydrocarbons
from imperialist Russia. Today, after decades of scientific research into climate change and
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we are ready to take that step more than ever before.
New methods of energy saving, diversification, storing and clean energy generation, developed
in many European scientific institutions to meet the goals of the Green Deal 2050 strategy are
ready. These efforts can and should be intensified, and the amount of investment into green
energy needs to be increased.

During the Covid-19 pandemic we saw the power of collective international community. Our free
societies endured the restrictions while the authorities of the European Union and its member
countries, together with scientists and industry took joint action aimed at unprecedentedly swift
invention, production and distribution of covid tests and a variety of a vaccines, thus saving
millions of human lives. We can do that again.

Today, witnessing Vladimir Putin’s war crimes, European nations are ready to take difficult
decisions. Let us take that momentous occasion and make that decision for the good of the
Ukrainian nation, for the good of the free democratic world and for the good of our planet.
